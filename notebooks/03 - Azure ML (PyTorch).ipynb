    "## A Brief Introduction to Containers\n",
    "When you access a web site or a software service across the internet, you're probably dimly aware that somewhere, the code for the service is hosted on a *server*. We tend to think of servers as being physical computers, but in recent years there's been a growth in *virtualization* technologies so that a computer can be virtualized in software, and multiple *virtual machines* can be hosted on a single physical server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual machines (VMs) are useful - in fact, the Azure Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) is a good example of a VM that enables you to provision a computer that contains the operating system (OS) and all the software applications you need to work with data and build machine learning models, and then you can delete the VM when you're finished with it so that you only pay for what you use - very cool!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it seems wasteful to provision a complete virtual machine, including the full OS and applications, just to host a simple software service - especially if you need to support multiple services, each one consuming its own VM. *Containers* are an evolutionary step beyond VMs. They contain only the OS components that are required for the specific software service they need to host. This makes them very small compared to full VMs, which in turn means that they're portable, and quick to deploy and start up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers themselves are hosted in a container environment that provides all the common services and OS functionality they require. During development, this environment is often a locally installed system called *Docker*. When hosting a service in the cloud however, you can use container services such as *Azure Container Instances* (ACI), which is useful for lightweight hosting and testing of containerized services; or *Azure Kubernetes Services*, which provides a scalable and highly-available environment for managing clusters of containers, based on the industry standard *Kubernetes* container hosting platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this notebook, we'll examine how you can use Azure Machine Learning Services to prepare a container image for your machine learning model, and deploy your model as a containerized web service that can be consumed by other applications that connect to it over an HTTP REST endpoint."
